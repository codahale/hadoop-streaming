Note, when izip() is used with unequal length inputs, subsequent iteration over
the longer iterables cannot reliably be continued after izip() terminates.
Potentially, up to one entry will be missing from each of the left-over
iterables. This occurs because a value is fetched from each iterator in-turn,
but the process ends when one of the iterators terminates. This leaves the last
fetched values in limbo (they cannot be returned in a final, incomplete tuple
and they are cannot be pushed back into the iterator for retrieval with
it.next()). In general, izip() should only be used with unequal length inputs
when you don't care about trailing, unmatched values from the longer iterables.
